# Sum of three numbers
Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. 
Every number is given on a separate line.

# Square
write a program that takes a number and print its square.

# Apple sharing
N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. 
The remaining (the undivisible) part remains in the basket. 
How many apples will each single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket?
+The program reads the numbers N and K. It should print the two answers for the questions above.

# Two timestamps
A timestamp is three numbers: a number of hours, minutes and seconds. 
Given two timestamps, calculate how many seconds is between them. 
The moment of the first timestamp occurred before the moment of the second timestamp.

# School desks
A school decided to replace the desks in three classrooms. 
Each desk sits two students. 
Given the number of students in each class, print the smallest possible number of desks that can be purchased.
The program should read three integers: the number of students in each of the three classes, a, b and c respectively.
-Ex-
In the first test there are three groups. 
The first group has 20 students and thus needs 10 desks. 
The second group has 21 students, so they can get by with no fewer than 11 desks. 
11 desks is also enough for the third group of 22 students. So we need 32 desks in total.

#Sum of digits
Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.

# Fractional part
Given a positive real number, print its fractional part.

# Car route
A car can cover distance of N kilometers per day. 
How many days will it take to cover a route of length M kilometers? 
The program gets two numbers: N and M.

# Digital clock
Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight 
- how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?
The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) 
and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).
-Ex-
For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight 
- i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the program should print 2 30.

# Total cost
A cupcake costs A dollars and B cents. 
Determine, how many dollars and cents should one pay for N cupcakes. 
A program gets three numbers: A, B, N. 
It should print two numbers: total cost in dollars and cents.

# Clock face - 1
H hours, M minutes and S seconds are passed since the midnight (0 ≤ H < 12, 0 ≤ M < 60, 0 ≤ S < 60). 
Determine the angle (in degrees) of the hour hand on the clock face right now.

# Clock face - 2
Hour hand turned by α degrees since the midnight. 
Determine the angle by which minute hand turned since the start of the current hour. 
Input and output in this problems are floating-point numbers.
